**How to get spotify refresh token?**

1. Get your Spotify client_id and client_secret
2. Get your access code
   Visit the following URL after replacing $CLIENT_ID, $SCOPE, and $REDIRECT_URI with the information you noted in Step 1. Make sure the $REDIRECT_URI is URL encoded.

   ```
   https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=$CLIENT_ID&scope=$SCOPE&redirect_uri=$REDIRECT_URI
   ```
   It will looks like this 
   ```
   https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=$CLIENT_ID&scope=user-read-currently-playing&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fshizuka.my.id%2F
   ```

   **You need to convert your website to URL Format for REDIRECT_URI, you can use this tool**
   [convert](https://www.url-encode-decode.com/)
4. Get code from the redirect URL
I was redirected to the following URL because my redirect URI was set to https://shizuka.my.id. In place of $CODE there was a very long string of characters. Copy that string and note it down for use in Step 4.
```
https://shizuka.my.id/?code=$CODE
```
4. Get the refresh token
   Running the following CURL command will result in a JSON string that contains the refresh token, in addition to other useful data. Again, either replace or export the following variables in your shell $CILENT_ID, $CLIENT_SECRET, $CODE, and $REDIRECT_URI.

   ```
   curl -d client_id=$CLIENT_ID -d client_secret=$CLIENT_SECRET -d grant_type=authorization_code -d code=$CODE -d redirect_uri=$REDIRECT_URI https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token
   ```

   The result will be a JSON string similar to the following. Take the refresh_token and save that in a safe, private place. This token will last for a very long time and can be used to generate a fresh access_token whenever it is needed.
```
   {
    "access_token": "$ACCESS_TOKEN",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "refresh_token": "$REFRESH_TOKEN",
    "scope": "user-read-currently-playing"
    }
```
