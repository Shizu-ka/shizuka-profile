## Hi <Twemoji emoji="waving hand" /> I'm Yosia

I am an undergraduate student in [Brawijaya University](https://filkom.ub.ac.id/), that have developed a strong technical skillset 
in **machine learning** and **data analysis**, including 
proficiency in **TensorFlow**, a popular deep learning framework. I have hands-on experience across the data analysis pipelines, from 
**data preprocessing** and **visualization** to model **development** and **deployment**. 

Complementing my technical abilities, 
I am also an adept **content writer** and blogger, skilled at translating complex topics into engaging and informative written pieces. 
Through my studies and personal projects, I have cultivated a diverse skill set that enables me to tackle a variety of tasks. 
I am a **team player** and responsible for my work proven by my experience in organizations and volunteer experience.
